Pytorch-Flower-Image-Classification

## Developing an AI application

Will train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. 

We'll be using [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories. 

## The project is broken down into multiple steps:

* Load and preprocess the image dataset
* Train the image classifier on your dataset
* Use the trained classifier to predict image content
